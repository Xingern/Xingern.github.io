# Welcome

Hi and welcom to my personal website. It is under development as I am adding new pages/functions. The 
background for this project started so that I can use what I learnt from the HTML/CSS courses at 
Codecademy. My goal is to use this site to display my CV and photography portfolio. 

As I am still learning, I apologize for any badly written code. If you have any suggestion, please
send me an email at xingdotmail@gmail.com. Thank you for your visit!

# Design and Structure

This part is mostly for myself so that i can remember what I am doing. The current design is inspired by the
CSS course on Codecademy and from freeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-developer-portfolio-website/). The buttons are from cssbuttons.app (https://cssbuttons.app/buttons/54). 

The general structure of the website is as following:

## Main Page
1. Top navigation bar
2. Welcome banner
3. About me
4. Navigation buttons
5. Contact

## The Student
1. Timeline

## The Photographer
1. Gallery

# Known Issues
1. Pictures not displaying correctly when downloading project. I believe this is cause by the file pathway
   since the root of the computer is not the same as on Github. A solution would to host the picture i.e. Flickr.  
2. Scaling, this website is currently not that mobile friendly.
