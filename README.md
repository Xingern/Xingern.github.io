# Welcome

Hi and welcom to my personal website. It is under development as I am adding new pages/functions. The 
background for this project started so that I can use what I learnt from the HTML/CSS courses at 
Codecademy. My goal is to use this site to display my CV and photography portfolio. 

As I am still learning, I apologize for any badly written code. If you have any suggestion, please
send me an email at xingdotmail@gmail.com. Thank you for your visit!

# Design and Structure

This part is mostly for myself so that I can remember what I am doing. The current design is inspired by the
CSS course on Codecademy and from freeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-developer-portfolio-website/). The buttons are from cssbuttons.app (https://cssbuttons.app/buttons/54). I am thankfull for favicon.io (https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/) for the icons. The timeline
used is made by Stas Melnikov (https://codepen.io/melnik909/pen/qPjwvq). The skills are made by ZhangZhuo (https://codepen.io/zhangzhuo/pen/vOwwKX). The template for the photography page was from templatemo (https://templatemo.com/tm-520-highway).

The general structure of the website is as following:

## Main Page
1. Top navigation bar
2. Welcome banner
3. About me
4. Navigation buttons
5. Contact

## The Student
1. Key skills 
2. Timeline (Overview)
3. Timeline (Courses + Studass.)

## The Photographer
1. Intro video
1. Gallery

# Known Issues
1. Pictures not displaying correctly when downloading project. I believe this is cause by the file pathway
   since the root of the computer is not the same as on Github. A solution would to host the picture i.e. Flickr.  
2. Scaling, this website is currently not that mobile friendly. Hamburger menu is also not implemented.
3. The social media icons need improvements, especially Instagram. I would also be cool to add box shadow,
   but the other icons behave weird. 
4. The HTML code behind the timelines are pretty messy, problems with indents and not that user friendly.
