# Welcome

Hi and welcome to my personal website under development. It's a side project for me to learn about webdesign. My goal is to be able to present myself, my interest and also projects. 

# Design and Structure

This part is mostly for myself so that i can remember what I am doing. The current design is inspired by the
CSS course on Codecademy and from freeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-developer-portfolio-website/). 

The general structure of the website is as follwing:

## Main page
1. Top navigation bar
2. Welcome banner
3. About me
4. Navigation buttons
5. Contact

# Know Issues
1. Pictures not displaying correctly when downloading project. I believe this is cause by the file pathway
   since the root of the computer is not the same as on Github. A solution would to host the picture i.e. Flickr.  
2. Scaling, this website is currently not that mobile friendly.
